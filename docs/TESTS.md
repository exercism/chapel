# Tests

To test your solution, open the terminal and run

```
mason test
```

in the exercise folder (the one containing the `Mason.toml` file and the `src/` and `test/` folders).

If you feel like the error message is not informative enough, you may try the following to get a more verbose one.

```
mason test --show
```
