# Help

<!-- TODO: write document

  This document should contain track-specific instructions on how to get help when
  the student is stuck.

  The instructions should be short and to the point.

  You could link to resources like Gitter channels, forums or mailing lists:
  whatever can help a student become unstuck.

  This document should **not** link to Exercism-wide (track-agnostic) help resources,
  as those resources will automatically be included in the HELP.md file.

  The links in this document can overlap with those in docs/LEARNING.md or docs/RESOURCES.md

  When a student downloads an exercise via the CLI, this file's contents are
  included into the HELP.md file.

  See https://exercism.org/docs/building/tracks/shared-files for more information. -->

The best places to get help with Chapel are [Chapel discourse](https://chapel.discourse.group/) or [stack overflow with chapel tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chapel). If you don't already find an answer there, feel free to ask a new question!

You can also ask on the [Chapel gitter](https://gitter.im/chapel-lang/chapel), but please consider the two options above, so that your question and the received answers may also help future people who encounter the same problem.
